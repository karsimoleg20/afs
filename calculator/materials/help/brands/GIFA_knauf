Gifa raised partial-access flooring systems are manufactured by Knauf in Germany, which is one of the largest manufacturers in the world. Floors fitted with calcium sulfate panels are ideal for areas requiring vinyl or hard finishes, such as stone and ceramic. One of the benefits of  GIFA floors is its usage as screed replacement, removing wet trade and allowing for easy under floor access.
