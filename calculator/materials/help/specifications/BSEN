The BSEN specifications were developed in 2001 by the European Committee for Standardization. Under BSEN, all floor systems are rated based on 72 performance standards in four categories: ultimate load, safety factor, deflection under working conditions, and dimensional tolerance. BSEN prioritizes certain criteria over others, allowing manufactures to test and self-certify. No guarantee is required with BSEN.
